# Global Covid report
This is my first ever vizualization project which includes the covid deaths and vaccination data. The sql file contains queries which is been used in tableau for vizualization.(but here i directly copy pasted data in excel and used it in tableau)
The vizualization comprises of field map, bar chart, line graph and a text table.
Text Table: Gives the global count of total cases,deaths and death %
Bar chart : Shows the distribution of total deaths per continent
Line Graph : Shows the avg % population infected (only selected countries) over period
Feild Map : Shows country wise % population infected distribution also forecast for next one year
